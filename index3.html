    <h1>HTML Important Questions</h1>
    <h2>Diff b/w Div and Span?</h2>
    <p>Both the tags (div and span) are used to represent the part of the webpage, <br><b>div tag</b> is used as block
        part of
        the webpage and <b>span tag</b> is used as a inline part of the webpage.

        <hr>
        <b>Div Tag:</b> The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content
        on
        the web
        page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. It will
        be
        displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>Span Tag</b> The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It used to
        group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes). A better way to use it when no other
        semantic element is available. The span tag is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and
        span is an inline tag.<br><br>
        Example of both tag:<br><br>
    <div>A Computer Science Portal for Geeks</div><br>
    <span>GeeksforGeeks</span>

    </p>
    <h2><b>Differences between div and span tag: </b></h2>

        <tr>
            <th>div tag</th>
            <th>span tag</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The div tag is a block level element.</td>
            <td>The span tag is an inline element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It is best to attach it to a section of a web page.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It accepts align attribute.</td>
            <td>It does not accept align attribute.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>This tag should be used to wrap a section, for highlighting that section.</td>
            <td>This tag should be used to wrap any specific word that you want to highlight in your webpage. </td>

    <h2>HTML Self Closing Tag</h2>
    <p> A self closing tags in HTML are the type of HTML tags that need not to be closed manually by its closing tag,
        which means there is no saperate closing tag for it as /tag.
        <br>
        A few examples of self closing tags are img, input, br , hr, etc.
        <br>
        Self closing tags are also alternatively known as void tags, empty tags, singletons tags, etc. i.e these tags do
        not have contents and also can not have any child.

    <h2>Difference between em and strong.</h2>
    <p> strong is a tag you'd put around a sentence or phrase to indicate that "this is more important than the
        surrounding text".<br>
        em is generally used to indicate the stress of a word within a sentence.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Difference between id and class?</h2>
    <p><strong>HTML id Attribute:</strong> The id attribute is a unique identifier that is used to specify the document.
        It is used by
        CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element. In CSS, the id attribute is written using the
        # symbol followed by id.</p>
    <p><strong>HTML class Attribute:</strong> The class attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an HTML
        element. The
        class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform
        certain tasks for elements with the specified class name. The class name in CSS stylesheet using “.” symbol.</p>
    <p>The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element,
        while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Difference between block and inline</h2>
    <p>The inline and block elements of HTML are one of the important areas where web developers often get confused
        because they were unable to know which are inline and block elements which may cause clumsiness in a webpage in
        case he assumes some element to be a block but it is an inline element which causes next element comes next to
        it.

        So let us see the differences between the inline and block elements in HTML and the different frequently used
        inline and block HTML elements.<br><br>

        <strong>Block elements:</strong> They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They
        always start in
        a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.<br><br>

        <strong>Examples of Block elements: </strong> h1 to h6, div, hr, li, ul, ol, p, table.<br><br>
        <strong>HTML 5 Semantic block elements: </strong> header, nav, footer, main, section, article, aside.<br><br>
        <strong>Inline elements: </strong> Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows
        other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and
        bottom margins as block elements have.<br><br>

        <strong>Examples of Inline elements:</strong> a, br, script, input, img, span, b, label

        <table border="2" cellpadding="8">
            <tr>
                <th>Inline Elements</th>
                <th>Block Elements</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements occupy only sufficient width required.</td>
                <td>Block Elements occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements don’t start in a new line.</td>
                <td>Block elements always start in a line</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind.</td>
                <td>Block elements doesn’t allow other elements to sit behind</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements don’t have top and bottom margin </td>
                <td>Block elements have top and bottom margin.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <h2>What are attributes?</h2>
    <p>HTML attribute is a property of an HTML element that can be used to add extra functionality to an element. For
        example, you can add a class attribute to an element to add a style to it or add a title attribute to create a
        tooltip when you hover over the element.</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are
            the modifier of the HTML element.</li>
        <li>Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.</li>
        <li>Attributes should always be applied with start tag.</li>
        <li>The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.</li>
        <li>The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it should be written in Lowercase only.</li>
        <li>You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Difference between HTML Tags and Elements</h2>
    <p><b>HTML Tags:</b> Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end
            with>
            symbol. Whatever written inside < and> are called tags.<br>
                Example: b, ul,etc. <br><br>
                <b>HTML Attributes:</b> It is used to define the character of an HTML element. It always placed in the
                opening
                tag of an element. It generally provides additional styling (attribute) to the element.<br>
                Example: in img tag src is attribute. <br><br>
                <b>HTML elements:</b> Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of
                structure
                or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.</p>

    <h2>What are sematic tags</h2>
    <p>Semantic tags are also known as naming tags . they were introduced to us in HTML5 and they help us to make our
        code more readable.
        There are two non-semantic tags i.e., div and span
