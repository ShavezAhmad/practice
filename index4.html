    <h1>HTML Mock Day1 Questions and Answers: </h1>
    <h2>Q1) Difference between div and span?</h2>
    <p>Both the tags (div and span) are used to represent the part of the webpage, <br><b>div tag</b> is used as block
        part of
        the webpage and <b>span tag</b> is used as a inline part of the webpage.

        <hr>
        <b>Div Tag:</b> The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content
        on
        the web
        page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. It will
        be
        displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>Span Tag</b> The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It used to
        group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes). A better way to use it when no other
        semantic element is available. The span tag is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and
        span is an inline tag.<br><br>
        Example of both tag:<br><br>
    <div>A Computer Science Portal for Geeks</div><br>
    <span>GeeksforGeeks</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Q2) Difference between class and id?</h2>
    <p><strong>HTML id Attribute:</strong> The id attribute is a unique identifier that is used to specify the document.
        It is used by
        CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element. In CSS, the id attribute is written using the
        # symbol followed by id.</p>
    <p><strong>HTML class Attribute:</strong> The class attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an HTML
        element. The
        class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform
        certain tasks for elements with the specified class name. The class name in CSS stylesheet using “.” symbol.</p>
    <p>The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element,
        while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. </p>

    <h2>Q3) HTML Self Closing Tag</h2>
    <p> A self closing tags in HTML are the type of HTML tags that need not to be closed manually by its closing tag,
        which means there is no saperate closing tag for it as /tag.
        <br>
        A few examples of self closing tags are img, input, br , hr, etc.
        <br>
        Self closing tags are also alternatively known as void tags, empty tags, singletons tags, etc. i.e these tags do
        not have contents and also can not have any child.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Q4) How many types of headings are there ?How to decide which to use where</h2>
    <p>A HTML heading or HTML h tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage.
        When you place the text within the heading tags
        &lt;h1 &gt.........&lt;/h1 &gt;, it is displayed on the browser in the bold format and size of the text depends
        on the number of
        heading.<br>

        There are six different HTML headings which are defined with the &lt; h1 &gt; to &lt; h6 &gt; tags, from highest
        level h1 (main
        heading) to the least level h6 (least important heading).<br>
        h1 is the largest heading tag and h6 is the smallest one. So h1 is used for most important heading and h6 is
        used for least important.</p>
    <h2>Q5) Difference between block and inline?</h2>
    <p>

        <strong>Block elements:</strong> They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They
        always start in
        a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.<br><br>

        <strong>Examples of Block elements: </strong> h1 to h6, div, hr, li, ul, ol, p, table.<br><br>
        <strong>HTML 5 Semantic block elements: </strong> header, nav, footer, main, section, article, aside.<br><br>
        <strong>Inline elements: </strong> Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows
        other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and
        bottom margins as block elements have.<br><br>

        <strong>Examples of Inline elements:</strong> a, br, script, input, img, span, b, label
    </p>
    <center>
        <table border="2" cellpadding="8">
            <tr>
                <th>Inline Elements</th>
                <th>Block Elements</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements occupy only sufficient width required.</td>
                <td>Block Elements occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements don’t start in a new line.</td>
                <td>Block elements always start in a line</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind.</td>
                <td>Block elements doesn’t allow other elements to sit behind</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements don’t have top and bottom margin </td>
                <td>Block elements have top and bottom margin.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>

    <h2>Q6) Difference between em and strong?</h2>
    <p>
        STRONG — semantic formatting tag. It conveys the high importance of the selected text. Visually looks fatter
        than the main text. It makes the text looks bold.<br>
        In HTML5, we use the STRONG tag for particularly important fragments. This is most relevant:<br><br>

        1. in the title or section title;<br>
        2. in the part of the text that has a special meaning relative to the other text;<br>
        3. to highlight important information, notify the reader about something;<br>
        4. to draw the reader's attention before he reads the rest of the information on the page.<br><br>
        EM — semantic formatting tag. Designed to transfer more expressive words or phrases relative to the rest of the
        text. Visually, the word / phrase is displayed in italics.<br>
        Use the EM tag when you need to pay attention to a specific part of the text. Especially if it can indicate
            the meaning.<br> Let us demonstrate a simple example:<br>
            <strong>It is done by strong tag</strong><br>
            <em>It is done by em tag.</em><br>
    </p><hr>
    <h2>Q6) What are attributes?</h2>
    <p>HTML attribute is a property of an HTML element that can be used to add extra functionality to an element. For
        example, you can add a class attribute to an element to add a style to it or add a title attribute to create a
        tooltip when you hover over the element.</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are
            the modifier of the HTML element.</li>
        <li>Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.</li>
        <li>Attributes should always be applied with start tag.</li>
        <li>The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.</li>
        <li>The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it should be written in Lowercase only.</li>
        <li>You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q7) Difference between HTML tags and elements?</h2>
    <p><b>HTML Tags:</b> Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end
        with>
        symbol. Whatever written inside < and> are called tags.<br>
            Example: b, ul,etc. <br><br>
            <b>HTML elements:</b> Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure
                or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an end tag.</p>
