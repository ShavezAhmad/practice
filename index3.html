    <h1>HTML Important Questions</h1>
    <h2>Diff b/w Div and Span?</h2>
    <p>Both the tags (div and span) are used to represent the part of the webpage, <br><b>div tag</b> is used a as block
        part of
        the webpage and <b>span tag</b> is used as a inline part of the webpage.

        <hr>
        <b>Div Tag:</b> The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content
        on
        the web
        page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. It will
        be
        displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.
        <br><br><br>
        <b>Span Tag</b> The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It used to
        group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes). A better way to use it when no other
        semantic element is available. The span tag is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and
        span is an inline tag.<br><br>
        Example of both tag:<br><br>
    <div>A Computer Science Portal for Geeks</div><br>
    <span>GeeksforGeeks</span>

    </p>

        <tr>
            <td>The div tag is a block level element.</td>
            <td>The span tag is an inline element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It is best to attach it to a section of a web page.</td>
            <td>It is best to attach a CSS to a small section of a line in a web page.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>It accepts align attribute.</td>
            <td>It does not accept align attribute.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>This tag should be used to wrap a section, for highlighting that section.</td>
            <td>This tag should be used to wrap any specific word that you want to highlight in your webpage. </td>
        </tr>

    <h2>HTML Self Closing Tag</h2>
       <p> A self closing tags in HTML are the type of HTML tags that need not to be closed manually by its closing tag,
        which means there is no saperate closing tag for it as /tag.
        <br>
        A few examples of self closing tags are img, input, br , hr, etc.
        <br>
        Self closing tags are also alternatively known as void tags, empty tags, singletons tags, etc. i.e these tags do
        not have contents and also can not have any child.
